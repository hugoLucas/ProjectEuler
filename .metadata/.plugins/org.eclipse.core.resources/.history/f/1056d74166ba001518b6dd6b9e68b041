/*
 * The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
 * What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
 */

/*
 * SOLUTION: Given a number N, that is NOT a prime number, the solution will be as 
 * follows:
 * 
 * 1. Generate a list of all primes less than n = N/2. I stop at N/2 because if n
 *    prime then the prime factorization will be n and 2 so any prime greater than 
 *    n cannot be used in the factorization. 
 * 2. Go through the list and divide 600851475143 by each number n_i. If mod n_i is 
 * 	  equal to zero then we know that number is a prime factor.
 * 3. Add n_i to a prime factor list and then repeat. 
 * 4. If mod n_i is not zero go to the next number on the list. 
 * 
 * This method should work only if N is not prime. If N is prime then prime list 
 * in step 1 will have to list prime numbers from 1 to N.
