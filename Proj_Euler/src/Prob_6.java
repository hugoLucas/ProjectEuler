 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 				(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers 
 * and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum 
 * of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

/*
 * SOLUTION: The sum of the squares for the range 1 to n is given by: 
 * 				Summation{i=1, i=N} (c_i)^2 
 * which is equal to: 
 * 		 		(c_1)^2 + (c_2)^2 + ....
 * The square of the sum for the range 1 to n is: 
 * 				(Summation{i=1, i=N} c_i)^2
 * or, when you distribute,
 * 				(c_1)^2 + (c_1)Summation{i=2, i=N}c_i + ...
 * In general, for the nth term the above summation must skip the nth index. Thus subtracting 
 * you get:
 *				 Summation{i=1, i=N}(c_i * (Summation{j=1, j=N, skip term when j=i}c_i))
